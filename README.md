    Long ago at this season, our people set out on a journey.

    On such a night as this, We went from degradation to joy.

    We give thanks for the liberation of days gone by.

    And we pray for all who are still bound.

This Passover Haggada slide-deck is culled from [The Velveteen Rabbi's](velveteenrabbi.com/VRHaggadah.pdfâ€Ž
), and powered by Remarkjs.  You can view it by opening `the-telling.html` in your web browser.

On a mac you can `erb content.md.erb | pbcopy` and then manually paste that into the `<textarea id="source">foo</textarea>` of `the-telling.html`.

Yeah, not very user friendly.
